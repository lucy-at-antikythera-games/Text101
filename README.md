# Text101

This text adventure is an exercise in loading basic assets to Unity, having text change in response to keyboard input, and building a crude finite-state machine using C#. The player types the character in brackets (`[]`) that corresponds to their choice to help the prisoner escape. The game consists mainly of two puzzles that should be easily solved.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine. Because this is simply a personal programming exercise, Text101 is not intended to be deployed on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Have [Unity 5.6.4](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) or later

### Installing

* Fork this repo
* Open Game.unity scene in the Assets folder in Unity
* Press the play button to enter play mode
* Press space to go past the title screen and start playing!

## Built With

* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive) - game engine

## Versioning

Release number is on the title screen of the game itself, in keeping with the flavor of interactive fiction games. As of this writing, the game is on release 0. I may clean up the code in a release 0.0.1, but because this is a learning project, I'm unlikely to go beyond that.
